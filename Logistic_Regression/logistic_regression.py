"""
The code is counting the best accuracy ad F1 score for Logistic Regression Model and different values of C.
The code is testing also other parameters: fit_intercept, class_weight, solver and multi_class.
The regularization hyperparamether C control how closely we allow the model to fit the training data.
If C is too high the model will tend to overfit. The optimal value for C can be found by experimentation.
